# Diabetes-Prediction-
In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. We basically used KNN since the dataset was small in comarision and quite suitable for KNN.
